## The challenge
Create a gaming application that can be played from people's mobile devices in arena, which allows them to interact with the hockey game in play or with the artist/group performing the concert.  Assume there are available score clocks/large LED's to interact with between patrons' mobile devices.  Ideally the game should allow participants to gain cumulative points to be used as an in app loyalty program or for redemption of other rewards. This game should enhance the overall in arena experience and not detract from the game or concert at hand.
